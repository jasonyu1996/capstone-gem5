## CAPStone gem5 simulator

This repo contains an out of order CPU model for CAPStone, built on top
of gem5's O3 CPU model. This design is intended to be used for performance evaluations.

This version of the CAPStone implementation is based on the CAPStone Academic Spec (vxx.xx, link)

## Dependencies

To build, make sure you have apptainer installed.
Then simply run the following from the project root directory:

```
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh <NUM_THREADS>
```

This will automatically build an apptainer image with all dependencies
required to build gem5, and use that image to build gem5 and run Capstone
functional tests.

The main source tree includes these subdirectories:
   - build_opts: pre-made default configurations for gem5
   - build_tools: tools used internally by gem5's build process.
   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
   - include: include files for use in other programs
   - site_scons: modular components of the build system
   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator
   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
   - tests: regression tests
   - util: useful utility programs and files
